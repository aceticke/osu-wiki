Another resident of the osu! community joins the ranks. Welcome **Krimek** to our Featured Artists!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/371/header.jpg)

Avid osu! mapper, former player, and tournament/contest host **Krimek** has expanded their osu!-related repertoire of skills even further by producing their own twist on tons of electronic subgenres. From breakcore to hardcore to techno and to drum 'n' bass, **Krimek**'s sound covers anything an osu! player could be looking for, inspired heavily by major producers in the rhythm game scene like *Supire*, *Taishi*, and our very own [*Camellia*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31).

**15** songs make up [**Krimek**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/371), including every tune from **Krimek**'s debut album *GALAXY OF MIND/MINE*!

If you're debating whether or not to map one of these tracks, gain some inspiration from [ChillierPear](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9501251) warming up to an intense tournament while vibing to one of **Krimek**'s many chill and soothing soundscapes:

## Featured Artist playlists

[At the start of last month](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-06-03-new-featured-artist-andora#featured-artist-playlists), we launched a batch of [**Featured Artist playlists** in osu!(lazer)](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-06-03-new-featured-artist-andora#featured-artist-playlists) for osu! and osu!mania. Now it's time to showcase the prize-winners!

For those out of the loop, playlist leaders earn prizes based on [this cumulative leaderboard](/wiki/People/Featured_Artists/Featured_Artist_playlists#cumulative-leaderboard). More specifically, anyone with 10 total points earns their own shiny profile badge!

### Cumulative leaderboard updates

We're currently reprocessing the last round of Featured Artist playlists after some recent changes to how scoring is handled on osu!(lazer). We expect this to take anywhere from 24–48 hours, so please check back then if you're interested in the results or updates on their progress!

Another playlist will be launched next week for **all modes** (alongside a *highly requested* new Featured Artist), so if you're itching to earn a profile badge of your own while listening to tier tunes, look out for that!

And of course, the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame) is the place to be for updates on anything and everything related to our new Featured Artists.
